Update Library Management.py
I have created a Library Management System using Python, which includes functions like load_books() and save_books() to manage book records in a JSON file. 
The log_transaction() function records borrow/return events with timestamps in a log file.
The system allows users to list books, search by title, author, or genre, borrow books (updating availability and setting due dates), and return books, with fines calculated for overdue returns.
The borrowing period is set to 14 days.
I have added five books: Think and Grow Rich, The 3 Mistakes of My Life, 2 States: The Story of My Marriage, The Discovery of India, and Kings of the Chessboard.
This system efficiently manages library transactions and ensures fines for overdue books.
